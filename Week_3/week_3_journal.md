I am not at all satisfied with this first version. I did the TDD approach. 
I wasted a lot of time thinking about what I was going to test.
I tried to apply the Clean Objet Calisthenics. 
I think I can do much better by creating objects for dice and squares.

I hadn't enough time to create the square objects but tomorrow I'm going to start from scratch but keep the same approach.
