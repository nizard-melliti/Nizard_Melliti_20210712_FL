02/08/2021 : 
I am not at all satisfied with this first version. I did the TDD approach. 
I wasted a lot of time thinking about what I was going to test.
I tried to apply the Clean Objet Calisthenics. 
I think I can do much better by creating objects for dice and squares.

03/08/2021 :
I hadn't enough time to create the square objects but tomorrow I'm going to start from scratch but keep the same approach.

04/08/2021 : 
I kept the same approach than yesterday and I had enough time to add the class Square with the test. 
Tomorrow to have engouh time to build my snake ladders class I will bypass the unit test for the class Dice and Square.


05/08/2021 : 
I have to create now the Snakes and Ladders class.

06/08/2021 : 
I didn't have time to add the objects Snakes and Ladders. I just had time to rewrite my code from yesterday and add a unit test.
I'm quite proud of the approach I've taken to the game .
