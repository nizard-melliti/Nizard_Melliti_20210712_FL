I choose the Kata "Convert Roman". Before Coding I started with the Message and Data-Flow Diagram and I identified the operation and integration methods.
During my 50 minutes'coding, I used the TDD methodology. I thing it's too early to think about what I can improve.
My fear is that every day I haven't enough time to code something new as I need to delete my coding everyday...
